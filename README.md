# Lingodeer Improvements

## Synopsis

Browser extension that tweaks the [Lingodeer Website](https://lingodeer.com/) by adding some quality-of-life features
that I felt were missing. Currently just modifies the exercises so that the textareas have smaller placeholder text,
automatically focus when they appear, and you can press tab when the textarea is on screen to focus on it.


## Future Plans

If I feel like tweaking this further, I would like to

* Make the clickable elements in the 'fill in the blank' exercises draggable
* Add a keyboard shortcut to the finish screen so that the enter key finishes the lesson
